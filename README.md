# OpenSourceFinal
 
The library I used as a dependency for my new project is the Steam Library Manager created by RevoLand. His project is on GitHub and is licensed under the MIT License. This license means this code is open source and free and can be used without limitations, as long as a copy of the original projectâ€™s license is provided. Since the dependency project is an MIT License, it allows me to use whatever license for my project as long as it does not violate it. Because of this, the new project that I created is licensed under the GPL v.3 license. I chose this license because it allows the code I created to be free and open source as long as a copy of the license in this project is provided in dependent projects. Because I want my project to be free to use, I chose this license so that any dependent projects that solely use this code that become commercial become open source. This license also states that any code that is modified must be noted which helps keep the distinction between authors for copyright purposes. The modified code must also hold a GPLv3 as it is not a brand new project.
